# Cervical-Cancer-Risk-Prediction
Early detection of the risk of cervical cancer using different machine algorithms.
Each year, hundreds of thousands of women lose their lives to cervical cancer, especially in developing countries where people often neglect/can't afford regular checkups and pap tests. This beginner-level project aims at an early detection of the risk of cervical cancer using different machine algorithms.
